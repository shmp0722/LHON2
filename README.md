This repository contains the scripts that Shumpei Ogawa wrote for his paper analyzing the properties of brain white matter in subjects with retinal diseases. 

The scripts here depend on functions in two other repositories related to the Vistalab.
  * AFQ - Automated Fiber Quantification
  * Visatsoft - The general set of routines the vistlab uses for processing MRI data

Example data sets for running the scripts related to the paper figures will be posted on the Stanford digital repository when the paper is printed.

If you use these codes please cite the relevant manuscripts describing the work:
